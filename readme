Project Title: Predicting stress using wearable sensors (Nurses) 
In this project used final_data.CSV 
for the final_data.csv used 2 diffrent dataset and combined that together.(Stress_dataset and SurveyResults.xlsx) 
final_data.CSV contain 810MB data. 
Which contain columns: Acc_X - x-Axis acceleration
Acc_Y - y-Axis acceleration 
Acc_Z - z-Axis acceleration 
EDA_Level - Electrodermal activity of the skin, measuring the skinâ€™s electrical conductivity.
Heart_Rate - Heart rate generated from BVP and IBI sensors. 
Skin_Temperature - Skin temperature in Celsius id - Anonymized Id of the user datetime - the datetime float 
              number that contains the time that signal was generated using the internal clock of the wristband. 
ID, datetime
Label - stress level from surveys
